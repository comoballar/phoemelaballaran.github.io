Without being consciously aware of it, I have been designing experiences for some time now.

I didn’t have a name for my process, I always just ask myself: “If I’m gonna be the one to use this, how would I feel when I’m using it?” and then proceed from there. It was only a few years ago when I encountered the term Design Thinking that I had the name for what I intuitively do.

At the core of my design process is, I think, my belief in beauty. And when I mention beauty, I echo the definition that John O’Donohue, a Celtic writer, gave in his book ‘Anam Cara’: “In its real sense, beauty is the illumination of your soul.” At the risk of waxing poetic, I think a good design is something that lets us have a glimpse of our soul.

One of the interesting areas of inquiry in designing experiences for web and mobile apps is "how can we bring forth a technology that respects our humanity?" Facebook has been heavily criticized for its use of Pavlovian conditioning to have its users hooked on visiting the site. This need not be the case. I think we have the capacity to shift technology into a form that enriches rather than enslaves.

It would be a worthy challenge to be given the chance to design meaningful experiences for end users, as I find that this effort involves application of combined concepts from different fields like human-computer interaction, psychology, information architecture, cybernetics, even sociology and philosophy.

At an event where Apple launched iPad 2, Steve Jobs summed up the company’s credo with these words: “It is in Apple’s DNA that technology alone is not enough—it’s technology married with liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields us the results that make our heart sing.” And with the world’s current state, don’t we need it now more than ever to have many hearts singing?
