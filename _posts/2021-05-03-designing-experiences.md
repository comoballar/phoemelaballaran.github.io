<p>Without being consciously aware of it, I have been designing experiences for some time now.</p>
<p>I didn’t have a name for my process, I always just ask myself: <i>“If I’m gonna be the one to use this, how would I feel when I’m using it?”</i> and then proceed from there. It was only a few years ago when I encountered the term <i>Design Thinking</i> that I had the name for what I intuitively do.</p>
<p>At the core of my design process is, I think, my belief in beauty. And when I mention beauty, I echo the definition that John O’Donohue, a Celtic writer, gave in his book ‘Anam Cara’: <i>“In its real sense, beauty is the illumination of your soul.”</i> At the risk of waxing poetic, I think a good design lets us have a glimpse of our soul.</p>
<p>It’s a worthy challenge to be given the chance to design meaningful experiences for end users, as I find that this effort involves application of combined concepts from different fields like human-computer interaction, psychology, information architecture, cybernetics, even sociology and philosophy.</p>
<p>One of the interesting areas of inquiry in designing experiences for web and mobile apps is <i>“How can we bring forth a technology that respects our humanity?”</i> Facebook has been heavily criticized for its use of Pavlovian conditioning to have its users hooked on visiting the site. This need not be the case. I think we have the capacity to shift technology into a form that enriches rather than enslaves, we just have to put a lot of thought into it and be attentive to people’s needs.</p>

<p>At an event where Apple launched iPad 2, Steve Jobs summed up the company’s credo with these words: <i>“It is in Apple’s DNA that technology alone is not enough—it’s technology married with liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields us the results that make our heart sing.”</i> And with the world’s current state, don’t we need it now more than ever to have many hearts singing?</p>
