<p>Without being consciously aware of it, I have been designing experiences for some time now.</p>
<p>I didn’t have a name for my process, I always just ask myself: <i>“If I’m gonna be the one to use this, how would I feel when I’m using it?”</i> and then proceed from there. It was only a few years ago when I encountered the term <i>Design Thinking</i> that I had the name for what I intuitively do.</p>
<p>At the core of my design process is, I think, my belief in beauty. And when I mention beauty, I echo the definition that John O’Donohue, a Celtic writer, gave in his book ‘Anam Cara’: <i>“In its real sense, beauty is the illumination of your soul.”</i> At the risk of waxing poetic, I think a good design lets us have a glimpse of our soul.</p>
<p>How can we bring forth a technology that respects our humanity? Facebook has been heavily criticized for its use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning" target="_blank">Pavlovian conditioning</a> in order to hook its users on constantly visiting the site. But despite the wide adoption of technology as a tool for surveillance and manipulation, I believe in our capacity to shift technology into a form that enriches rather than enslaves. We just have to dig into what lies beneath our surface-level needs, to also be attentive to what illuminates our souls. The existence of <a href="https://numinous.productions/ttft/" target="_blank">tools for thought</a>—software that helps <i>humans be more thoughtful, creative, and fulfilled in their intellectual pursuits</i>*—affirm this belief.</p>

<p>It’s a worthy challenge to design meaningful digital experiences for people, as I find that this effort involves application of combined concepts from different fields like human-computer interaction, psychology, information architecture, cybernetics, even sociology and philosophy. This thought is captured by Steve Jobs' words when he summed up Apple’s credo (them following it in a moralistic sense and beyond the aesthetic is a topic for another time): <i>“It is in Apple’s DNA that technology alone is not enough—it’s technology married with liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields us the results that make our heart sing.”</i></p>
<p>And with the world’s current state, don’t we need it now more than ever to have many hearts singing?</p>
